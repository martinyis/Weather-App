## Reflection

I took on this weather app project as an educational opportunity to practice my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I specifically wanted to use DOM manipulation and local storage, as well as get some experience with the ES6 syntax.

When I set out to build this app, I had a clear vision of the features I wanted to include. I wanted to show the current and future temperature, use different images depending on the temperature, and provide detailed information about the weather. I also wanted to include the ability to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

One of the most challenging aspects of this project was implementing the search bar and the functionality that would show the weather based on the user's search input. It took some trial and error to get this working properly, but in the end, it was a really good learning experience.

In terms of tools, I used Figma for the public design and Visual Studio Code as my coding tool. I stuck to using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the main functionality of the app, although I did make use of a weather API to bring in the necessary data. Overall, I'm quite happy with how the app turned out and feel like I've gained a lot of valuable knowledge and experience through this project.
